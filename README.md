# Hacker-News-Posts-Analysis

The goal of this project is to analyze posts from Hacker News, a site where user-submitted stories are voted and commented upon. We are specifically interested in posts whose title begin with Ask HN and Show HN to determine what type of posts and time receive the most comments on an average.
